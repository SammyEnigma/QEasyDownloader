# Deploying your apps

I really recommend you all to use dynamic linking on all platforms and then pack it with simple containers this way you can   
avoid the overhead of static compiling and also make it just work! :dog:

In windows you can simply throw in the dll files and compress it into a setup file and distribute it to the users but its   
different in linux , refer this [Qt Doc](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linux-deployment.html) for information on deploying qt apps.   

In addition you can use [AppImages](https://github.com/appImage/appimagekit) and [linuxdeployqt](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt).

# Thank You ![Thank You](https://img.shields.io/badge/Always-Say%20Thank%20You!-blue.svg?style=flat-square)

I really need to thank the developers of this libraries for creating it because QEasyDownloader is elegant because of them! :heart:

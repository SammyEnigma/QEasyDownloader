Hey folks , The good news is , QArchive's Documentation is up and running with no errors   
and the **best** part is , The documentation is **freakin** sexy and thus I've decided to   
use docusarus for all my **project** documentations.

I really recommend you folks to use this and **slash** is really cool.   
Some **errors** in **docusarus** just made me get mad at it sometimes but you all know that   
I'm a developer afterall , So I **fixed** some small erros but I still **can't** get a single   
warning to disappear but anyways the **site** looks **greate** and I've documented everything   
I know , I hope users will **like** this new change!

Looking forward to have more users for **QArchive** , **See ya!**

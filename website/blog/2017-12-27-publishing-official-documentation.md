Hey everyone , After using **slash** with **QArchive** I was so much satisfied and thus   
I totally switched to **docusaurus** for all my documentations , it feels really good   
to create awesome **documentations!**.   

**I think** users will learn more about **QEasyDownloader**.

**But** still this is taking more time than I thought and thus I'm frustrated with this   
documentation stuff , **man!**. It would be awesome if I got some **documentation** engineers!   
**Oh anyways!** I'm looking forward for more users for **QEasyDownloader**!

**See ya!** , I hope I could finish my mainstream project within this **winter holidays!**

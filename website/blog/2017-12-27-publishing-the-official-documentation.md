Hello everyone , I know that I already published a Wiki for QArchive at github but I thought it   
would be good if the documentation and other guides are published with some awesome styles   
and illustrations. So I am recreating the Wiki in **Docusaurus** , that is not the only reason ,   
I also wanted to try out **Docusaurus**. Unlike the **Wiki** this site holds all feeds for the   
small **header** , a **blog** , **docs** and most of all **react!**. I think you would learn   
more about **QArchive** on here to github **Wiki**.   

So far so good , **Docusaurus** looks good to me. Stay in touch for more feeds on **QArchive**.

Hey everyone , I don't know if you know this but developing a software is easier compared   
to writing a documentation for the users. I've started writing documentations for my   
libraries and its kinda of boring. Will get back to you when I finish all my   
documentations.

**See ya!** , I hope I can finish the documentation today.
